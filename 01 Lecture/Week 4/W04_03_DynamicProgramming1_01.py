Dynamic programming
    A general algorithm design technique for solving problems defined by or formulated as recurrences with overlapping sub-instances
Main storyline
    Setting up a recurrence
        Relating a solution of a larger instance to solutions of some smaller instances
        Solve small instances once
        Record solutions in a table
        Extract a solution of larger instance from the table
"""

"""
Memoization
    Key technique of dynamic programming
        Simply put
            Storing the results of previous function calls to reuse the results again in the future
        More philosophical sense
            Bottom-up approach for problem-solving
                Recursion: Top-down of divide and conquer
                Dynamic programming: Bottom-up of storing and building
